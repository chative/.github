## We, humans, have natural ways to communicate. We say things to each other in private, then we forget over time. Chative is here to do that digitally.

* __Chative is fully encrypted end-to-end__. All your messages, whether it’s a 1:1 chat or a group chat, are fully encrypted in-transit or at rest.


* __Chative does NOT store your messages__, not on the server side, and not on the client side. You can choose to store messages for 1, 7 or 30 days. After which, the messages are gone. There are no permanent storage options.


* __Chative does not store metadata__. Metadata often reveals more than the contents of the messages themselves. Chative prefer not to know that. Once a message is delivered, no other info about the message is kept.


* __Chative does not require a phone number__. You should be able to chat with others without disclosing your phone number.


* __You can register on Chative with an email address__. And you can disable people’s ability to find you by email.


* __Chative is not designed for viral growth__. It is not easy for people to find you. You can invite or connect with friends with a unique link or QR code. Chative is designed so that only your friends can find you.


* __Chative is open-source__. We believe secure apps should be transparent in how they work. Chative is free. No ads. Chative does not collect or sell data.
